The AI engineer successfully progressed the Drivers Chat application, evolving it from a basic social platform into a more feature-rich product. The development was iterative, addressing user feedback and new feature requests sequentially. Key areas of work included: implementing a robust like/dislike system with auto-deletion (requiring significant backend and frontend synchronization, including the introduction of enhanced post endpoints); developing user profile enhancements like profile picture uploads; creating essential static pages such as Help, About, Terms & Conditions (with pre-login/register consent); implementing admin post deletion; and undertaking a comprehensive internationalization effort, starting with English, Turkish, and Spanish, and moving the language selector to the login screen. Throughout this process, the engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, particularly in identifying and resolving frontend caching issues, API endpoint mismatches, and JavaScript syntax errors. The current task involves completing the full application translation to ensure all parts of the app respect the selected language.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on completing the full application translation (internationalization). After moving the language selection to the login screen, the user pointed out that only the login screen was translated, and other pages remained in English.

The AI engineer initiated the process of translating the entire application, starting with the  file to ensure that users experience the selected language consistently across the app. The last action in the trajectory involved making edits to  to translate its content, but the task was interrupted mid-way due to hitting a token limit. This means the translation of the  file is incomplete, and further translation efforts for other pages are yet to begin.

The current state is that a basic language selection mechanism is in place, and some core translations exist in . However, the integration of these translations across all  screens is ongoing, with  being the latest file modified for this purpose.

Relevant files and functions currently being worked on:
-   : Currently being modified to translate its texts.
-   : Contains the  and  object that needs to be expanded for full app coverage.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue the full application translation, starting with completing the  file and then moving to other pages.
