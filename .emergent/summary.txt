The AI engineer continued developing the Drivers Chat application, focusing on extensive internationalization for English, Turkish, and Spanish. Key features implemented include a referral system with deep linking, a mandatory professional driver checkbox for registration, backend support for Push Notifications and a Search feature, basic Comment UI, Profile Edit in Settings, Block User functionality, and an Emoji Picker for posts. A significant addition was the Emoji Reaction system for posts, complete with backend and frontend integration. The engineer also addressed legal concerns by replacing branded terms with generic ones. The work consistently involved updating  and relevant frontend  files, managing edits efficiently to handle token limits, and restarting Expo. The immediate work before this summary was the backend implementation of a Report System, and the trajectory concludes with a discussion on admin access.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully implemented the backend for the **Report System**. This included defining a  model and creating the  endpoint to allow users to report posts or other users. Frontend translation keys for reporting features were also added.

The next planned step was to integrate the frontend UI for the Report System by adding a report button and modal to . However, this was interrupted when the user asked, ben admin bölümünü nasıl kullanabilirim (how can I use the admin section?).

The AI engineer then paused the Report System frontend work to explain the existing admin features:
1.  Admin users can delete any post.
2.  Admins can view and review/resolve reports.
The explanation also covered how to make an account an admin (currently only by direct database modification).

Therefore, the work on the Report System frontend is pending, and the current discussion revolves around admin capabilities and how to access them.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Ask the user if they want to proceed with making their account an admin or if they have more questions about admin features.
