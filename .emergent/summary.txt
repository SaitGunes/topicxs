The trajectory details the evolution of a mobile application from a single-purpose Drivers Chat to a multi-sector platform named Topicx. The work, conducted in Turkish, started with backend and frontend modifications to support sector-based data isolation. A significant portion of the effort was dedicated to fixing a bug in the Edit Profile feature, where  was not saving correctly, which was resolved by updating backend Pydantic models and frontend Zustand state.

Following this, the focus shifted to UI/UX improvements based on user requests, such as displaying selected professions on the profile page and removing the bio feature entirely. A major pivot occurred when the user requested a complete database reset to rename it from driverchat to topicx and create a single admin user.

The latter half of the trajectory is dominated by a persistent and challenging effort to prepare the application for iOS App Store submission. This involved extensive troubleshooting of local development environment setup on the user's Windows machine (installing Node.js, npm, etc.), debugging Expo Go connection errors (fixed by correcting  variables), and numerous failed attempts at creating an iOS build using An Expo user account is required to proceed.

Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username. The build failures were traced to dependency conflicts, incorrect bundle IDs, and configuration issues diagnosed by . The very last action was a radical attempt to fix the build by creating a minimal  with only core dependencies, which is the immediate context for the next step.

<product_requirements>
The project's goal is to transform the Drivers Chat application into Topicx, a multi-sector community platform where users can join communities like Drivers, Sports, etc. Content (posts, chats) is isolated per sector.

**Completed Work:**
- **Rebranding:** App name, logos, and all user-facing text changed to Topicx.
- **Sectorization:** Backend and frontend adapted for multi-sector data handling. All sectors are now active.
- **Profile Overhaul:** A complex Edit Profile screen was built for users to add multiple professions and workplaces, which are now displayed as badges on their profile. The bio feature has been removed.
- **Database Reset:** The entire database was wiped, renamed to , and a single admin user was created.
- **Voice Messages:** The feature was temporarily disabled due to a bug with playing back base64 audio on iOS. A Coming Soon message is now shown.

**Current Goal:**
- Publish the application to the Apple App Store. This involves resolving all technical hurdles preventing a successful iOS build via Expo Application Services (EAS).

The application follows a monorepo structure with a  and  directory.



-   ****: The main FastAPI application file. It was modified to add a  field to the  model and update the  endpoint to handle profile updates for this new field.
-   ****: A one-time script created to programmatically add a new admin user to the fresh  database after the system reset.
-   ****: A critical configuration file for the Expo app. It was heavily modified to change the app name to Topicx, set the  to  to resolve a conflict on the user's Apple Developer account, and correct schema errors found by .
-   ****: This file has been the source of major issues and was the focus of the final actions. It was repeatedly modified to fix dependency conflicts causing the An Expo user account is required to proceed.

Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username to fail. The last action was to replace it with a minimal version containing only core Expo SDK 54-compatible packages.
-   ****: This screen was updated to display the user's selected professions (from ) as styled badges above the now-removed bio section.
-   **** & ****: The voice message recording functionality was disabled in these files. The microphone icon's  event was changed to show a multi-language Coming Soon alert instead of opening the  modal.
-   ****: This file was corrected to fix a critical Expo Go connection issue. The  was outdated and was updated to the correct ngrok tunnel URL, allowing the user to connect with their iPhone.

Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username failure for iOS. After multiple failed attempts due to dependency conflicts (like 'folly/coro/Coroutine.h' not found) and issues identified by , a radical approach was taken. The  file was completely overhauled and replaced with a minimal version containing only the essential core dependencies compatible with Expo SDK 54. This was done to eliminate any potential conflicts from outdated or unnecessary packages. The yarn install v1.22.22
